# Project initialization

  - [ ] First [install Truffle. See documentation here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)
  - [ ] Create a workplace for this project

> The following commands initializes a truffle project in the **$HOME/tut** directory.

```sh
$ cd   # navigate to $HOME folder
$ mkdir tut && cd $_   # make a tut folder and navigate into it.
$ truffle init
```

# SimpleStorage Behavior

We want to write a Smart Contract with a simple API: set its value, and read its
value.  To do this we need to have the following.
  - [ ] a smart contract, `SimpleStorage`
  - [ ] some way to define the behavior of `SimpleStorage`
  - [ ] the ability to verify `SimpleStorage` behaves the way we defined

We will use aspects of [Behavior driven development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development), and [Test driven
development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) methodologies to work through this tutorial. We will define
new behavior in truffle test files and implement contract logic to achieve that
behavior.

This approach lets us to examine the system in small testable pieces while
increasing our knowledge and intuition of Truffle, Solidity and the ecosystem.


## the contract test

We need to define the behavior of our contract. Let's create our SimpleStorage
test-file, invoke test, and examine its output.  We will use the `truffle
create test` command to scaffold a truffle test.

``` sh

$ truffle create test SimpleStorage
$ truffle test
```

``` sh

> :warning: :information_desk_person: This error means SimpleStorage is missing in action!



Truffle test mocks! It compiles and deploys the contracts we write to a local
test blockchain every time we run `truffle test`.  Our only behavior, the
expectation that `SimpleStorage` is deployed, fails because we have not yet
introduced this contract to our project.

> :point_right: [Be sure to study the test code before proceeding](./test/simple_storage.js) :point_left:


## the Contract subject

Now that we've defined the SimpleStorage behavior, let's introduce the contract
to our project and rerun the test.  The command `truffle create contract` adds
an empty contract to our project! This is where we will implement our desired
contract behavior.

``` sh
$ truffle create contract SimpleStorage
$ truffle test
```

Insights from test errors increases our knowledge and confidence in our Smart
Contract evolution and lets us focus on implementing contract logic without
wrestling with complicated testchain business.  Here's what `truffle test` does
at a high level to facilitate that focus:
  - starts a local test chain
  - compiles all contracts it knows about
  - deploys those contracts
  - calls all the tests in the system and displays the results

> Recall that Truffle scaffolded an initial migration script.
> [Review it to see how it deploys a Contract](./migrations/1_initial_migration.js)

## the migration

Truffle test will execute all the deployment scripts in [lexical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20lexicographic%20or,order%20of%20their%20component%20letters.).  We will have to write one for our SimpleStorage contract.

> :information_desk_person: a migration script is the place to define a Smart Contract's deployment

> filenames.

Create the SimpleStorage deployment `migrations/2_deploy_simple_storage.js`
and then execute another test

``` Solidity
const SimpleStorage = artifacts.require("SimpleStorage");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(SimpleStorage);
}
```

Execute Truffle test

``` sh
$ truffle test
```

:tada: Congratulations! If you see a similar output then you have:
  - [x] a smart contract, `SimpleStorage`
  - [x] a way to define the behavior of `SimpleStorage`
  - [x] a way to validate its behavior is correct

## business logic

Lets focus on the business logic of our smart contract now that we have the
test, contract and migration pieces in place

Our SimpleStorage contract should have:
  - [ ] a state, `storedData`. This is the location to store an integer value
  - [ ] its `storedData` value at deployment be 12
  - [ ] a function `getStoredData`, to retrieve the current `storedData` value.
  - [ ] a function `setStoredData`, to set the `storedData` value.
  - [ ] a constructor to set the initial value of `storedData`.
  - [ ] a contract `owner`.
  - [ ] a way to ensure only the contract `owner` is able to call the `setStoredData` function.


### define initial deployment value of storedData

Add the following code to the test file and execute truffle test.

``` JavaScript
contract("SimpleStorage", (/* accounts */) => {
  describe("Initial deployment", async () => {
    it("should assert true", async function () {
      await SimpleStorage.deployed();
      assert.isTrue(true);
    });

    it("was deployed and its intial value is 12", async () => {
      // get subject
      const ssInstance = await SimpleStorage.deployed();
      // verify it starts with 12
      const storedData = await ssInstance.getStoredData.call();
      assert.equal(storedData, 12, `Initial state should be 12`);
    });
  });
});

```

#### test: watch it fail

Since we defined a new behavior we expect the test to fail. Lets see how the
system reports this expected failure.

### implement getStoredData

update SimpleStorage.sol to
  - declare a public uint256 named storedData
  - add a public view named getStoredData that returns the contract's state storedData

``` Solidity
contract SimpleStorage {
  uint256 public storedData;

  function getStoredData() public view returns (uint256) {
    return storedData;
  }

}
```

#### test: getStoredData

  - [x] its `storedData` value at deployment be 12
  - [x] a function `getStoredData`, to retrieve the current `storedData` value.
  - [ ] a function `setStoredData`, to set the `storedData` value.

> :information_desk_person: Please note, we have declared and initialized the storedData variable, but solidity has rules for default values for unintialized variables. See [section](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/control-structures.html#scoping-and-declarations) from the Solidity documentation.

### define setStoredData behavior

Lets implement the next part!
  - [ ] a function `setStoredData`, to set the `storedData` value.

Add the following `describe` block to our test and run truffle test.

``` javascript
describe("Functionality", () => {
 it("should store the value 42", async () => {
   // get subject
   const ssInstance = await SimpleStorage.deployed();

   // change the subject
   await ssInstance.setStoredData(42, { from: accounts[0] });

   // verify we changed the subject
   const storedData = await ssInstance.getStoredData.call();
   assert.equal(storedData, 42, `${storedData} was not stored!`);
   });
 });

Let's make sure we have accounts in our tests.  Uncomment `accounts` so test
entry point reads as:

``` javascript
  contract("SimpleStorage", function (accounts) {
```

Run truffle test

```sh
$ truffle test
```

#### implement setStoredData

The following line in the output indicates that `setStoredData` is not a
function. We should fix that.

```
  TypeError: ssInstance.setStoredData is not a function
```

Add the following function to the SimpleStorage contract

``` solidity
function setStoredData(uint256 x) public {
  storedData = x;
}
```

# Conclusion

Truffle with a BDD and TDD workflow is a powerful way to develop and test Smart contracts. It keeps you focused on the activities of contract development and testing by mocking the blockchain, managing identities and converts your tests and assertsions into transactions for you.

See you in the next episode where we'll continue our exploration with Ganache and Sandboxes.
